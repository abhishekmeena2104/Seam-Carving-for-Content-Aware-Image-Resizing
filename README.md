Description

>>>In this work i implemented the Mean Shift Image Segmentation method. 
>>>Mean shift clustering is a non-parametric kernel density estimation technique that clusters points based on repeated
 updation of the mean. 
>>>Used a kernel based on joint distance using the color and (x,y) locations. Evaluated different 
 kernels for image segmentation. Also checked and evaluated the effect of the bandwidth of the kernels on the resulting 
 image segmentation. 
>>>>The method was evaluated on a number of images.
